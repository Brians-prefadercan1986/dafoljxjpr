OMG, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Ad Vitam, and wow, my brain is officially melted into a puddle. It’s like, seriously, they took the idea of immortality and just went all-in, ya know? So, these people don't die, right? They just hang around doing the same thing over and over again, but it’s chill because they don’t. Actually. Die. It’s like a repetitive loop of endless existence. Wait, is that what being a vampire would feel like? 🧛‍♀️  

But seriously, so many questions. Like, can you imagine turning a certain age and then just... not aging? Forever a teenager with all the permanent angst and awkwardness? Yikes. I mean, I get the appeal of eternal youth, but at what cost? Isn’t it wild we’re here casually chatting about 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   like it’s just another Thursday thing?

> And, okay, the detective guy. So intense. Does he ever 𝘤𝘳𝘢𝘤𝘬 a smile? I’d love to meet him at a party just to see if he’d actually relax. Spoiler alert: highly unlikely! But anyway, b𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬 and mysterious with that whole slightly dystopian vibe. Perfect for zoning out and letting the existential dread settle in nicely over popcorn. 🍿

Oh, and not to mention the visuals! Kind of like Black Mirror meets Blade Runner but with a European twist. You probably gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   just to absorb all those moody landscapes and the whole gray-ish city vibe. Some scenes felt like a sad painting brought to life—almost poetic, in a way. 

randomVariable = 42; // Honestly, why would I even type this here?

Anyway, I think I’m off to dream about living forever or whatever philosophical tangent this   sent me on. Let’s catch up soon, or better yet, let’s invent a way to live forever and chat in a hundred years! Haha, but seriously, let’s plan a   night soon.
